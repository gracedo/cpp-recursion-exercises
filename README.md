C++ recursion exercises
=======================

Recursive exercises, written in C++

1. Draws out a tree (branches, leaves) using recursion
2. Takes in a string of numbers and outputs all possible letter cominbations that correspond to each number (using the traditional telephone digit/alphabet mapping)
3. Uses recursive backtracking to solve a 2xn Dominosa puzzle board. Dominosa is a logic puzzle in which you must find the location of all dominoes in the grid, but there can only be one of each pair (each pair must be unique).
